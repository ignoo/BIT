    <p><span>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp</span>Brookesia nana, also known as the nano-chameleon, is a species of chameleon endemic to montane rainforests in northern Madagascar. Described in 2021, it could represent the world's smallest reptile. Unlike some chameleons, Brookesia nana does not change colors.</p>
    <p><span>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp</span>The nano-chameleon is blotchy brown in color. Adult males measure 22 mm (0.87 inch) in total length (including tail), while females are slightly larger at 29 mm (1.1 inches). Like other Brookesia species, females are generally larger than the males. The reasons for its diminutive size are currently unknown, as many vertebrates grow as they mature.</p>
