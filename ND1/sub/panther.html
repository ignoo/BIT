    <h1>Parson's chameleon</h1>
    <h3><i>Calumma parsonii</i></h3>
    <div>&nbsp</div>
    <p>The Parson's chameleon is usually considered the world's largest chameleon by weight and one of the largest by length (where it is surpassed by the Malagasy giant chameleon). Adult males typically weigh 500–700 g (18–25 oz), have a casque on the top of their head and ridges running from above the eyes to the nose, forming two warty "horns". There are two recognized subspecies: The widespread nominate subspecies, Calumma p. parsonii, of both lowlands and mid-elevation altitudes, has no dorsal crest (no spines along the back's ridge) and reaches up to 65 cm (26 in) in total length including tail; there are reports of individuals exceeding 80 cm (31 in), but they remain unverified. The other subspecies is Calumma p. cristifer from mid-elevation altitudes in the Andasibe area, which has a small dorsal crest (small spines along the back's ridge), weighs less and generally reaches up to 50 cm (20 in) in total length, although there are reports of individuals up to 60 cm (24 in).</p>
